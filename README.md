# Predictive Behavioral Analysis and Brain Tumor Identification for Elderly Care

## Introduction
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict potential health or behavioral issues in elderly individuals based on patterns in their daily routines, mobility data, and communication habits. Additionally, the model aims to identify brain tumors using MRI image analysis, combining behavioral analysis with medical diagnosis for comprehensive elderly care.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project contains various features representing:
- **Daily Routines:** Sleeping patterns, activity levels, and mobility patterns.
- **Communication Habits:** Frequency and duration of social interactions.
- **MRI Images:** Brain scans labeled for tumor detection.

### Data Sources
- Behavioral data is gathered from wearable devices and daily logs.
- Medical data is obtained from publicly available MRI image datasets.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves:
1. **Handling Missing Values:** Using imputation techniques for missing data.
2. **Scaling and Normalization:** Applying Min-Max scaling and Z-score normalization as appropriate.
3. **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converting non-numeric data to numeric representations.
4. **Resizing and Normalizing MRI Images:** Standardizing image size and scaling pixel values for input to neural networks.

## Data Visualization
- Daily routine patterns are visualized through line plots and bar charts.
- Heatmaps are generated for correlation analysis of various features.
- MRI images are displayed to visualize tumor regions.

## Feature Engineering
- Extracting meaningful features from time-series data.
- Applying convolutional neural networks for MRI image feature extraction.
- Combining behavioral features and medical features into a unified model.

## Splitting Data
- The dataset is split into **Training, Validation, and Testing** sets.
- For MRI images, a separate validation set is used to evaluate model performance.
